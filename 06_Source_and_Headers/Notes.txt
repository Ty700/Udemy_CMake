In both app and src we have 

add_library()

What if we have a lot? We would need a lot of these to include each header.

So in the src CMakeLists.txt

we can set a variable to represent the library files

set(LIBRARY_SOURCES
    "my_lib.c"
    "another_libary.c"
    "third_library.c")

then set your library headers

set(LIBRARY_HEADERS
    "my_lib.h"
    "another_library.h"
    "third_library.h")

now, instead of having 3 add_library functions, we can just do:

add_library(${LIBRARY_NAME} STATIC
    ${LIBRARY_SOURCES}
    ${LIBRARY_HEADERS})

See src/lib CMakeLists.txt for implementation.
