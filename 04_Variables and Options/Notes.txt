For example:
	we have add_library(Library STATIC my_lib.c)
		- Library is a variable name

	What if I didn't want to remember the spelling of the Library variable?

	In the root CMakeLists.txt we can set a variable name with a value

	set(<var_name> <value>)

	Common to indicate variable names with all uppercase
	set(LIBRARY_NAME "Library")
		- we could leave the quotes out and CMake will get the right type since values can be int values

	set(EXECUTABLE_NAME Executable)
	
	Now, in the my_lib CMakeLists.txt we can do:
	add_library($(Library), my_lib.c)
