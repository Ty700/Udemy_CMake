Generating a project
    cmake [<options>] -S <path_to_src> -B <Path_to_build>
        Example:
            cmake -S .. -B . //the src path is one higher than the current one, and the build directory is the current one

Assuming that you have already built the CMake project, you can update the project by:
    cd build
    cmake .
